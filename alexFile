//alexs little secret 

Write a method which prints out the numbers from 1 to 30 but
for numbers which are a multiple of 3, print "FIN" instead of the
number and for numbers which are a multiple of 5, print "RA" instead
of the number. for numbers which are a multiple of both 3 and 5, print
"FINRA" instead of the number.
Solution 1:
public static void FINRA( ) {
String result = "";
for(int i=1; i <= 30; i++) {
if(i % 5==0 && i %3 ==0)
result += "FINRA ";
else if(i%5 == 0)
result += "RA ";
else if(i%3==0)
result+="FIN ";
else
result += i+" ";
 }
System.out.println(result);
}
